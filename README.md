# nodeQuizGame
Final Project for my Web API class. Simple quiz game that grabs questions from a mongoDB database and send them to the game using Socket IO. Questions can be added using a custom editor window in Unity or there is a webpage running on  local port 3000 where you can view all the questions and edit them.


(Must have node installed to run)

How to Open:

cmd to nodeQuizGame\Server and call npm start to run the app
You can then run the build and it will work off the database.
If the app is not running it will run off a local save file that contains whatever the questions were the last time it was run with the app running

(High scores will not show if running without the app running)
